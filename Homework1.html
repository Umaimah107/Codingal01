<p>Theres been a starvation alert sent round by the BBKA this week  “ I do not think anyone can have failed to notice that the weather has not lived up to expectations so far this season. We have heard from many beekeepers that they have inspected colonies recently which are at major risk of starvation.”

    Bearing this in mind, what have bees got to feed on at the moment? Bramble (blackberry) flowers are about, which will be helpful. A couple of weeks ago I took the photos of giant vipers bugloss below, which bees of all kinds seem to love.

    <p>The foxgloves and oxeye daisies are doing really well in my garden this year. I often see a bumblebee bottom disappearing up a foxglove bell. The oxeye daisies are visited by delicate metallic beetles which shine in the sun. And this week I saw a new visitor – the bee-fly. I noticed this curious creature because it hovers like a hummingbird in front of flowers, but has spindly legs like a spider and a long tongue like a moth. Very fast and hard to photograph by the way.</p>
